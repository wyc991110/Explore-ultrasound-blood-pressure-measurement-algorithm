This code is written in python as a result of the research internship named Explore ultrasound blood pressure measurement algorithm.
Introduction for the methdology can be found in the report FP.pdf.
The code contains FMCW signals and mixed signals from two transducers. The method to get blood pressure is introduced in J. Seo, S. J. Pietrangelo, H. - S. Lee, and C. G. Sodini. “Noninvasive arterial blood pressure waveform monitoring using two-element ultrasound system.” In: IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control 62.4 (2015), pp. 776–784.
